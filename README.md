# University-Student-Financial-Enterprise-Model

## Executive Summary
Every year it is observed that 10 million students fly to foreign countries to pursue their higher studies. The application process starting from choosing a university, loan process and graduating from the university from a good job in hand is a tedious process. There are many applications in the industry that focus on one aspect of students i.e., either on their application process or choosing a financial organization for their education loan or helping a student to find a good job. For example, applications like yocket focus on finding the best university to the student, applications like WemakeScholars help students take education loans from the
best financial organizations and applications like LinkedIn, Glass door helps student land in a good job. But there is no single application that can handle the student data from the application stage to his employment stage. This combined data helps us to draw many insights that are otherwise impossible with single application dealing with only one section of data. The database was modelled considering all the data that the application process, loan process and employment process of a student involves in. The tables were populated based on real time data. EER and UML diagrams were modelled and these conceptual data was mapped to relational model to populate the tables with the data. Primary and Foreign key constraints were stipulated across the relational model and database implementation in MySQL using all the tables were shown. To have an illustration in No SQL database, Neo4j database is queried using Cypher with 8 nodes out of 11 available. The SQL and NoSQL database implementation worked well and was able to fetch data as expected. The database efficiency and working is tested by connecting the database to Python language. Python’s Seaborn library is used to visualize the output of SQL queries. The queries and the Visualization results matched and provided the correct output as expected. As technical expectations of any project has no boundaries and always there is a scope to improve. There are few aspects that we can improve technically to include few more features and provide better suggestions to the students.
## 1. Business Problem Definition and Requirement :
The current data model focuses on gathering data from the students in two different phases of their career. This data helps organizations like banks, NBFC’s to make efficient decisions in disbursing loans to the students of a particular university and also helps students with accurate and proper information about their study in abroad. Therefore, we can consider it as a complex collection of data from different phases that a student passes through in his career right from applying to foreign universities to repaying loans after landing in a job. This model also helps banks to evaluate student profiles based on the university they got admit to and provide with better loan schemes. From the perspective of students this model provides them with a clear view about the financial and academicals planning they need to arrange before they start with their university education. People with similar interests can form groups to co-ordinate on different steps in the process of reaching to a different country. Once the students are aware of the rules and protocols of different academic standards before they start with the academics it allows them to prepare from the university perspective. The data model helps universities to find out the major companies that hire fresh graduates and the major locations that students from the university work in. This database helps universities to build strong connections with the companies that hire frequently and also prepare
curriculums with respective to industry standards. From the perspective of banks, our data model provides them with a statistical evidence on the success rate of different types of loans disbursed to students who wish to continue their studies across different countries  The following are the rules to be followed while implementing the data model.
  1. The Applicant entity has an attribute fee range which has to match with the university fee range while recommending the universities.
  2. One student can apply to different departments under the same university but can be admitted to only department of a university
  3. One student receives loan from one or zero banks while one bank can grant loans to any number of students.
  4. One student as one employer while one employer can employee any number of students.
  5. The employment table here in the model denotes the first job that a student joins after the graduation.
  6. Banks cannot provide loan more than 80% of the value of the collateral property of the student.
  7. The Rate of interest for collateral loans should be less than non – collateral loans in the same bank.
  8. Financial organisation has to grant loans only to students parents having eligible credit score
  9. A university can be in multiple locations and multiple departments. Departments can offer multiple courses. Each course can have multiple students. Each course      has onecourse requirement.
## Design of the database
To create a database for the business we identify the tables as Applicant, University, Department, Course, Student, Financial Organisation, Address, and Employment
Organisation. Each Applicant can apply to ‘n’ universities for ‘n’ courses provided by ‘n’ departments. Student will accept admission from only one university. Financial Organizations can provide loan to ‘n’ students based on the Credit score and collateral value of the student. Student works in the organization after their graduation. The Repayment of loans by the students is calculated once they start earning at the respective organization. One organization can employee ‘n’ students from the university while one student can be employed by ‘one’ organization. The address of the financial organizations, Company University and students are recorded so that universities can better predict the locations from which geographical locations students majorly come from and where they land in jobs after the graduation. We have used Navicat, Excel and Gitmind for developing data model for the business case

## 5. Accessing Database Using Python
Python’s Seaborn library was used to visualize the output of SQL Queries. The graphs data
matched with the output of SQL queries.
Mysql Database is connected to python using Mysql.Connector and mycursor.execute and
mycursor.fetchall() is used to fetch the query outputs. Seaborn package is used to visualize
the query outputs.

## 6. Summary and Recommendation
The Students database in My SQL helps students to choose universities based on their profile and observe the trends in the companies that hire students from the universities. Based on the intake of students to the universities and their pay range financial organizations can prioritize educational loans to the students. Python Seaborn package is used to analyse and visualize Number of students to different countries, average salary range of students graduating from each university. All the data imported and populated is real data which helps in drawing better insights. The data is also analysed and visualized using Neo4j graph database. Cypher
language is used to query the Neo4j database. One improvement in the database model that we observed after designing the database is there can be few GPA Centric and Research Centric colleges that give preference to students having achievements in these respective fields. By calculating the percentile of each student among all other students for a particular intake we can determine the highest percentile value of a student among GRE Scores, GPA, and Research Work. These statistics can be leveraged to provide better university suggestions to the students. Also the Veracity of data is a concern to be noted. As there are many organizations that try to take an advantage of these type of applications by introducing fake student profiles which would change the accuracy of the model and affect its efficiency. Taking inputs from only valid international students by introducing a feature of mentioning passport Number or Mobile Number to use this application would answer this security concern.
